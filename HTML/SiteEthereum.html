                      <p class="P1">What is Ethereum ?</p>
                      <p class="R1">The Ethereum (ETH) is a digital currency, the project around the coin has more potential than Bitcoin. Ethereum technology, not only aims to create coins, but also to implement the Blockchain system, concepts that Bitcoin has brought and that creators of Ethereum have applied perfectly. <br> <br> Blockchain is Ethereum's technology, developed as a decentralized platform, aimed at executing smart contracts. That is, creating applications that will support themselves: there will be no third party interference, fraud or system downtime. The applications created in blockchain are set up within a block of blocks. Coming in August 2014, the Ethereum project was developed by ETHDEV, a non-profit organization in Switzerland and featured the world's largest minds in cryptography. It has a wallet or wallet Ethereum is where you store the digital currency, called by the money servants in intelligence form.You can download it to the ether wallet on the company's own website and save it on the desktop of your computer, this is a half more safe to store the cryptomoedas.

                    <p class="P2">Mining Ethereum ?</p>  
                    <p class="R2">The coin has the second position of the top 10 of the most famous Crypto-Coins and as a consequence the greater difficulty to MINERATE ETH. To mine ETH, you need validation of blockchain network transactions. By validating users' transactions on Ethereum's Blockhain network, you earn rewards, or digital coins. The problem is that if mining involves high energy expenditure, the costs you will have to mine ETH do not cover profit. It is therefore unfeasible to mine alone. <br> <br>
                    How to Minimize Ethereum? The most advisable to start mining Ethereum is to find a pool, a group of miners, which will guarantee more chance of you finding your coins. To mine ETH, you will use your hardware, more precisely the mining will happen to the GPUs. The algorithm of the mining is called: Casper Proof of Stake. The algorithm of ethereum uses more the graphic card in the mining process, because it is where it would be easy to obtain the ether coins.

                    What do you need to mine? Computer with video card, power supply, HDD / SSD storage. Internet to validate the Blockchain transactions and the Ethereum mining software downloaded on your computer and updated.

                   <p class="P3">How to Buy Ethereum ?</p>      
                    <p class="R3">It is possible to buy the digital currency at brokers and Exchangers. The Exchangers is where you will trade, other criptomoedas or physical money through the Ethereum. Buying Ethereum is less labor intensive than undergoing the mining process, as it will require you to invest in a good processor computer and operating costs, such as electric power. <br> <br> Currently the ETH value is US $ 1,100, but the currency has already cost $ 6. Who kept the Ethereum during those years in the portfolio saw the currency suffer an absurd appreciation and profited a lot. Most people buy ethereum and store it in their desktop wallet, waiting for currency appreciation. Imagine you bought for the price of $ 1,100 and selling for $ 3,000,000 in a few months.

                    <p class="R4">Mining in the clouds may be more viable, it is basically the same thing your the physical computer would do in the house. You will only have to rent the processing capacity by professional companies in the mining business, you will need to hire monthly or annual plans that fit into your budget and see if the profitability of ethereum coins are profitable by the amount invested in the processing power.
