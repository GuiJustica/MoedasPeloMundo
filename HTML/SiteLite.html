                      <p class="R1">Litecoin (LTC) is a criptomoeda known as "the silver". Lite is meant to be an alternative currency in the market (altcoin).

                    <p class="P2">Who Created Litecoin ?</p>  
                    <p class="R2">Charlie Lee, a former software engineer on google, started studying encryption and decided to create a Bitcoin-inspired coin. He identified some technical problems that caused him to create his own currency on fairbix, a currency that was unsuccessful in the market. It was a real failure, but served as the basis for the Litecoin that emerged in 2011. The origin of the Litecoin name means Light Currency. Litecoin or LTC, which is its acronym trading in the Forex market, is really light. It has 8 decimal places. The creator of Litecoin, did not want to take the clamour of bitcoin. Charlie wanted Litecoin to be the new silver on the market and that bitcoin was still GOLD. In fact, bitcoin remains the most famous currency and is worth even more than physical gold itself. Lee cares very much about market sentiment about Litecoin. He recently disbanded all of his holdings in Litecoin because he was accused of influencing currency prices because of his comments on social networks. Lee, made the coin so that the population was accessible. Sell ​​your shares, did not affect the price of Litecoin and another one is already rich. Your creator's commitment to the currency is visible. Even without stakes in the company, he still oversees the performance of litecoin. That has earned him a lot. Litecoin's capitalization is estimated at $ 10.66B. The daily volume of business is around $ 363.24M.

                   <p class="P3">Litecoin's Value</p>      
                    <p class="R3">The LTC occupies the seventh position of the main criptomoedas. It is a good placement and its market value is estimated at 191 US dollars. About 601.95 reais, with the dollar price of R $ 3.15. $ 191 is a high quote for a crypto. Litecoin's investors achieve a high turnover on the day. Note that Stellar, Cardano and Ripple are newer digital currencies and stand in front of Litecoin, as daily trading and capitalization volumes exceeded that of Litecoin. It does not matter that the price of these crypto coins is lower. They will still be in the ranking for being more negotiated. Cheap coins give space for investors to capitalize more. These new digital coins, Cardano, Stellar and Ripple, have a different technology, technically not obtained through mining. They are generated by the protocol and can be purchased.

                    <p class="P4">Litecoin Mining</p>
                    <p class="R4">The mining process are mathematical operations that your hardware will do. To mine, you need to download Litecoin's mining software from their website. Or download from some pool, like minergate, where you join a group of miners. The Software is easily found on the internet; Litecoin Mining, is made by scrypt technology, which levels the difficulty of mining. The idea is that you can mine from your computer, with the same difficulty that a professional miner would have. The legal thing about litecoin is that it levels mining, but the mining process has energy and operational costs. Maybe your personal computer does not have a good cooling capacity, that's because your hardware will be brought to full capacity during litecoin mining. As your computer warms up, your power bill may rise. The recommended one would be to have a specific computer and to stand for 24 hours on. You have to think about the cost benefit and calculate if litecoin mining will be feasible. It may be that it does more harm than good.

                    <p class="P5">Market Trends</p>
                    <p class="R5">The litecoin even hit 418 US dollars in October 2017. The higher price but also a price resistance. It is the most interesting region to sell. The market has been keeping prices well in the range of $ 200 - $ 190. Current prices are a region of price correction. The market trend is also high. The expectation for long and medium term is that the currency will seek even higher price levels. That is clear, if prices do not reach $ 180. Which could mean a downtrend for litecoin.
