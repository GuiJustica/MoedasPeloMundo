                      <p class="P1">What is Stellar  ?</p>
                      <p class="R1">Stellar is a trading platform among currencies. Uses the blockchain system to connect public and private routes on a network. Also created by the company were the digital coins, the Lumens, known in the market as XLM. Stellar coins have made it easier to change who uses their platform. It is one of the intermediary assets. The idea around the platform is that we can have the centralization of money, manage multiple currency pairs and crypto-coins in one place. To record the data from them, so you'll know where your money went and be able to manage it, reducing the work of accounting. For banks this system is enriching and helps in operationalization.

                    <p class="P2">Who Created Ripple ?</p>  
                    <p class="R2">The creator of Ripple (XRP) then, he left the Ripple project in 2013 and created Stellar Lumens. The main competitor to XRP. He launched the Stellar project in 2014, one year after leaving Ripple.Jed already has support from international banks for his new platform, such as: - National Australia - Wizdraw (HK) - WorldCom and TD Bank In addition, the new Jed platform is already being used by payment systems: ACH and SEPA. Banks have begun investing in digital assets in the long run, to central banks begin to issue their own crypto-coins. The Stellar platform is helping financial institutions to develop in the digital marketplace.

                   <p class="P3">About the Currency</p>      
                    <p class="R3">But the creator claims that it would be confusing to have a coin called Stellar, so they developed the asset named after Lumens. So do not confuse, the name of the coin is Lumens or XLM its trading acronym in the market.There are about 100 billion coins set up. The idea is to make the currency a facilitator among the other pairs of currencies of the Stellar platform. On the platform are already traded, the physical currencies: dollar and British pound. They will still need to add another 7 currency pairs, including Australian and New Zealand dollars. Just like Ripple, created by Jed Mccaleb, he wants to create a payment system where you can send money to anyone you want and where you want. easier for you to understand the concept of the Stellar platform is to think about E-MAIL: E-mails are also a network, you can have an email from GMAIL and send a message to one from YAHOO, any message. And that at no cost! Now think, you did it instantly and for free, even the email from your sender being from another provider. Unlike other crypto-coins where you download the wallet to your desktop. Stellar does not offer the offline version of the wallet. The wallet are via web or online, they are on the internet. For active-there you will need 20 XLM in your balance. And to make it active you still need to confirm your identity with a Facebook account, otherwise you will not even receive the funds you have purchased. Promote technology for individuals with access to financial services. Develop the confidence of these services so that people can improve their financial management. Stellar wants to ensure the ease and economy of your money. Where you can send to where you want without major problems and guarantee lower rates in the transactions.

                    <p class="P4">Valuation of Stellar Coin</p>
                    <p class="R4">Investors are eyeing XLM, its appreciation in the short term was interesting. Before long she was already on the top 10 list of the most traded crypto coins in the world. It has 6th place now. Stellar is heading for 1 US dollar, according to technical analysts. Prices have been respecting the support regions. The buyer volumes are larger than the sales, this ensures the health of the bullish trend, meaning we will see the XLM for a few more months if valuing.
