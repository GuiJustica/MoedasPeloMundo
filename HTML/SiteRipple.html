                      <p class="R1">The Ripple project came about in 2011 is a payment centralization system and also a digital currency, the famous XRP. First you need to understand that Ripple is divided into: Payment System, called RippleNet and XRP, the digital currency associated with technology RippleNet. You can use XRP within RippleNet, convert currencies from other countries to XRP and vice versa. Everything is connected, the success of the payment platform and the appreciation of the currency, go together. The more people using the Ripple protocol, the more value the XRP will have.

                    <p class="P2">Who Created Ripple Coin ?</p>  
                    <p class="R2">The Creator of the coin is Jed McCaleb. A US programmer, who had been developing platforms that failed for years. Until he became interested in encryption by seeing Bitcoin, he studied the coin and discovered technical flaws. <br> Jed opened OpenCoin, the company responsible for Ripple, then teamed with David Schawart, a leading cryptographer, and Arthur Britto, OpenCoin strategist. Things were not working out, in 2013 he left the project because of disagreements in company management and personal conflicts, he decided to resign. Now, Jed McCaleb is engaged in a new project, Stellar, Ripple's main rival. In the same year that Jed resigned, the company changed its name, OpenCoin became Ripple Labs. The largest investor in the project is an executive business, very famous in Silicon Valley. His name: Chris Larsen, well-known for having successful projects in his investments.

                   <p class="P3">How does Ripple Coin work ?</p>      
                    <p class="R3">The Ripple protocol is meant to be the most secure payment method on the internet. This is the idea of ​​the developers: to allow safer transfers, in a shorter time and with the lower rates. They have a link with banking institutions. Banks use the blockchain network on their wire transfer systems to connect to Ripple. This application is a little bit off the principle of decentralization. After all it is a digital currency, controlled by banks! But think, the crypto-coins want to replace the physical money and give freedom to the users, this harms the banking institutions. Not to lose to digital coins, they applied the cryptography to the banking system, so they can compete with the crypto coins. But the concept is not just this, we will explain later, the system. <br> <br> The main cryptographer, David Schwartz tried to explain the protocol, see: Schwartz says that payment systems are individualized, people need to use different systems to pay their bills. One system is not able to interact with the other. Ripple wants to unify payment systems. So companies start to control the flow of money and get more information about where it is going (information flow control). But ripple is not against the ideal of digital currencies for not keeping the concept of decentralization ? Not much, the Ripple platform is designed to make transfers on your network with multiple currency pairs, among them Bitcoin. All this done in just 3.4 seconds! Understand that Ripple is a payment protocol, so it is not mined with hardware. The Ripple proposal is to make the transfer of the coins quickly and cheaply. <br> Think now, you have an e-mail from the G-mail and send a message to another from Yahoo. You did this for free and fast. Even though he's from another provider! <br> Ripple is the same. They want to merge the coins into your network, so you can send that currency you want to Ripple wallets anywhere in the world. Therefore, they needed to unite the crypto-monies system with banking institutions, to include physical money in the Ripple protocol.

                    <p class="P4">How many coins will circulate in the network ?</p>
                    <p class="R4">About 100 billion initially. The company intends to distribute about 50 Billion, the rest of the currencies will be used to finance the open source and project of Ripple Labs. Then you will get a percentage with the company. The currencies themselves supported the Ripple protocol. But basically more than half of the XRP is with the creators. We estimate that only 38,739,144,847 XRP are in circulation on the internet.

                    <p class="P4">Buy XRP ?</p>
                    <p class="R4">In order for your Ripple wallet to be considered active, you need to buy 30 XRP and keep it in your account. You will need at least 25 XRPs to remain in your wallet to make it functional. This is a baseline reserve value.  <br> Ideally, you should make a purchase of 55 XRPs, so you can have money to keep account activity and be able to negotiate, create orders, etc. The current price of the currency, reached $ 1, more precisely $ 1,303, about 4.03 reais (dollar worth: 3.10). <br> <br> Prices have sustained the movements of the market. In December XRP was worth 0.8 cents and rose to 1 dollar, a level that has sustained well. Even with the other criptomoedas falling, XRP continues to value. It has the 3rd place of the most traded crypto-coins.
