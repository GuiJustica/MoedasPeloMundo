                      <p class="P1">What is EOS ?</p>
                      <p class="R1">The crypto-EOS was released with much anticipation and controversy. According to its developers, this new virtual currency would also serve as the basis for new fully decentralized applications, which would in the beginning launch a new wave of investments and web innovations that would jeopardize all other competitors. With an ambitious and with a unique initiative, EOS was able to capitalize quickly, causing many users (and investors) to keep their eyes open on the promises that have been made. EOS is still a kind of "mystery" to many people. Its definition is complicated and its objectives seem to have enough potential to create a true innovation capable of making the other crypto-currencies become practically obsolete. To simplify everything, we can consider EOS as a "common" crypto-currency, a system that serves as the basis for new fully decentralized applications. The closest comparison we can make is with the Ethereum currency, which in addition to being a crypto currency, is also a powerful payment system that is used daily by thousands of people around the world. However, the promises of EOS are even bigger, where developers claim that applications like messengers can be fully built from their blockchain system. Whether this idea is realistic or not (or even functional), only the future can tell us, since EOS has only recently been tested. Its construction and its test is public, and the expectations are very high.

                    <p class="P2">How does Ethereum work ?</p>  
                    <p class="R2">The cryptomedeo works in a similar way to all others. It is possible to carry out commercial and personal transactions with its use.Each infrastructure (or system) EOS, in theory, guarantees a "fertile ground" for the creation of completely decentralized applications. Its operation is not yet clear and the project is currently in the testing phase. However, since most people are interested (at least at this point) in the investments part, it is possible to say that the outlook is great and that there is a possibility of valorization for this criptomoeda that has great disruptive potential.

                   <p class="P3">How to Buy EOS ?</p>      
                    <p class="R3">The EOS can be purchased on its official website and on other trading platforms such as Bitfinex. In the official website, the price tends to be cheaper, since there are no fees and charges for the purchase. Note that it is necessary to have a wallet virtual to be able to acquire their tokens. Do not forget that your registration on the trading platform (or on the EOS website) and in your digital wallet must contain all your actual data. The possibility of valuing EOS is very high.

                    <p class="R4">According to the company's white paper, the open source EOS.IO platform is being built to enable instant transactions and high scalability. While some other crypto-sedans experience latency and increase slowness as they climb, EOS says it will not suffer from such problems. Therefore, in addition to the platform appeal it could have for developers, it could also have strong outlets for criptomoeda traders, since speed and scalability could improve the liquidity of the EOS token.
